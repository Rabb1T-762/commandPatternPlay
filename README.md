# Command Pattern Play

This is my place to play with the Command Pattern from the Gang of Four book.

I'll be using different languages and paradigms to implement the pattern.

## First Attempt

### JavaScript OOP
Language: JavaScript
Paradigm: Object Oriented

OK, so technically I've done this before, but I want to give it another go. 

Last time I did a simple calculator app.
This time I'll be doing a simple undo/redo stack. 

Let's see what happens :)

### JavaScript Func
Language: JavaScript
Paradigm: Functional

This is a slightly more interesting step. This is the first time I'm trying to implement a pattern without OOP.

Let me give it a shot.
